In the past three years, I've put on 170 lbs.

I routinely get sick. I hate my job, myself and every decision I’ve made that got me here. But that changes today (tonight, but whose counting).

In my younger years, it was all about money. Getting more of it to fund my hobbies, but eventually, software development took over more and more of my life and I lost sight of the things I actually valued. Telling stories, playing music and enjoying my life.

Of course, I can’t blame software development. The culprit is none other than yours truly. My relationship with work has always been a sore point for me. Getting fired is the greatest shame and in response, I let work take too much of life until there was nothing left. I’ve sacrificed my health, sanity, and education in order to placate work and ensure my continued employment. But now I’m 30, 370lbs and without even an associate’s degree after five years of college. That changes today.

I’m not quitting my job. I have a family to support and a mortgage. I’m going to change how I engage with work in order to save myself. I’m going to continue my education, get my degree and keep going. I’ going to lose the weight and I’m going to tell my story. I’m going to tell all the stories I can think of, be it in short form or on my YouTube channel. I need to focus on becoming a person I actually want to be instead of whatever I am right now.

I’m worried that my kids will look at me as an example of how they should live. I’d very much hate for them to get the wrong impression. My kids are the best people I know and they deserve to have a father that loves himself at least half as much as he loves them. Honestly, my biggest fear right now is that they’ll find me dead. Either by a heart attack or from my own doing. So I’m going to do everything I can to make sure that never happens.

While I absolutely dread the thought of New Year’s Resolutions, I can’t ignore the fact that I’m writing this in Mid-December. So indulge me while I list my goals for the next year.

Goals:

1. Read a lot of books.
2. Write at least 500 words a day (blog entries, short stories, videos, whatever as long as it’s telling a story)
3. Get my chess ELO to 1500
4. Start my YouTube channel
5. Learn German
6. Complete my associate’s degree and transfer to university
7. Lose 50lbs. Because weight is going to become a serious problem.

I know, I know. A lofty set of goals, some obviously much easier than others. But, it’s the path I choose. It’ll be a challenge, but I’d rather fail trying than to die doing whatever I’m doing now.

In the future, I’ll write out what I’m learning, write some fun stories and hopefully find an outlet that doesn’t involve me laying in a bed eating Taco Bell at 2 in the morning. One can certainly dream.
