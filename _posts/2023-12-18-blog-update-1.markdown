Once you build momentum, everything gets easier. I don’t know if I’ll ever get further than writing 500 words a day. I really want to try.

It started with reading On Writing by Stephen King and The War of Art by Steven Pressfield. Technically, I listened, but the message was the same. Be available to the Muse and she will give you what you need. So maybe, just maybe, I’ll get something of value other than personal blog entries trying to absolve myself of the guilt of my creative laziness.

I also want to break my academic view of writing. While editing my prior post, I found myself tortured by unnecessary words and turns of phrase designed to inflate my word count instead of just getting an idea across. I only have one more class left where I have to write essays, so hopefully I can become a better writer by then. I’ve gotten a B and A in English Composition One and Two, but I want to be an enjoyable read and not just meeting basic requirements.

I think my biggest fear in writing is being creatively lazy. Even this post concerns me. I’m not writing a story, just my thoughts on what I’m doing. I worry many people like to concern themselves with the meta of what they’re doing instead of actually doing it. A sort of paralysis by analysis that stops you from doing anything risky or creative. My next post will be a short story. I won’t post it daily, but I will add to it day by day and post after editing and the other parts of the process.

I’m also taking this as an opportunity to try out another Stephen Kingism I picked up from On Writing. I don’t want to make a story map. I’ll start with a situation and see where the muse leads me. Whether it's bad or good, I took a chance and did something. Now. Just need an interesting situation. I’ll spend the rest of the day brainstorming.

Heck, if it’s a good one, maybe I can make the YouTube video adaptation of it. That would be something, Chris Layton, technically a screenwriter and author. What a world we live in.

I want to give personal updates and talk about my life. It makes me feel better to put down the real things and events of my life. It helps to leave a record and helps me get stuff out of my head. So don’t worry about losing a personal connection just yet.

Reading-wise, I’ve kept up with my goal to read more. I’m at about a pace of a finishing a book a week for the last three weeks. My concern was that I wouldn’t be able to make a habit out of it, especially when I got to reading a book as long as 11.22.63, but I kept at it. Helps that the books are good, though sometimes I think I’ll enjoy anything as long as it’s competent. It could be a blessing or curse, though I think the 11.22.63 is definitely more than just competent. I want to pallet cleanse a little. The last two books were both Stephen King books (The Shining and 11.22.63). I’m going to re-read the first Harry Potter book, a breezy 400 pages, then jump into Stephen Kings epic, The Stand. That will probably take me to the end of the year AT LEAST.

So long for now. See you in the funny papers with a story on the next update.
